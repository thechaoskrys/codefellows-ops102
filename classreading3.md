# Readings: Startup Sequences and BIOS

### BIOS and CMOS

### Questions from Assignment
1. What is the BIOS?
- The BIOS is basic input output system. It is permanent software programmed onto the motherboard that uses other components in the computer to make that the operating system is able to load smoothly.

2. Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
- The first step in the booting process is the POST (power on self test). I am not sure how to create an anology so I'll be doing my best to explain it with my own words. POST checks all the different things that are essential to the booting process going smoothly. During this process it talks to the monitor, keyboard, mouse, RAM and ensure they are all functioning. Once everything is checked, it is communicated with the processor that everything is functioning.
- The BIOS goes through all connected devices that may contain bootable media to see where the operating system is located and if it can be booted.
- The BIOS cycles through the different hardware to ensure they are all working efficiently and that the settings are compatible with the booting of the computer.
- In the CMOS setup utility, the ability to change different setting of the BIOS is available. One is able to enable or disable hardware components.
- The BIOS is a middle-man between hardware and the operating system during the booting process. Once the boot up is complete, the BIOS takes a step back and allows the hardware to communicate directly with the operating system.

3. What is the “Power On Self Test”?
- The POST is used to ensure that all hardware components are working efficiently.

4. What is the CMOS?
- CMOS is the ability to modify the BIOS settings.

5. What is the CMOS battery?
- The CMOS battery is a lithium coin cell. It is needed to provide power to another component which is needed for the booting process. 

### Notes from article 
- BIOS (basic input output system). Used to load the operating system when cpu is turned on.
- BIOS' process of loading the computer operating system into the main memory RAM. this is considered the booting process.
- Booting process ends when operating system is fully loaded into RAM.
-  CMOS: small battery powered RAM. holds user settings and other data used for the booting of cpu. (complimentary metal oxide smiconductor)
-  Everytime the computer is turned on, it provides access to the ROMBIOS, BIOS/CMOS set up.
-  CMOS batteries last approximately 5 years.
-  The CMOS battery is accesible on PCs but much more difficult and invasive process on laptops.
-  CMOS holds static RAM, which requires power at all times to continuously hold info like the time/date, and BIOS settings.
-  When the CMOS battery fails it messes up the BIOS ability to access the data needed for booting.
