## How to Build a PC

### Notes from the article

- Key components of a PC, regardless of its purpose - CPU (processor), motherboard, RAM, storage drive, power supply, case, graphics card, and cooling system.
- CPU usually a large part of budget.
- https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Cheap-Gaming-Computer (return to for reference)
- the type of RAM that is supported by motherboard will be in motherboard's documentation.
- hard disk drive (HDD), solid state drive (SSD), NVMe or M.2. SSDs are faster than HDDs.
- graphics card may only be important in a gaming or editing PC. this may be the most or 2nd most expensive purchase in a build (next to processor).
- power supply - buy more wattage than is needed.

### Questions from assignment 
1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
In a CPU, the processor's speed and amount of cores both hold significance. Which one is most important might be based on what the PC will be used for and what is most important to that particular person. The speed determines how fast the CPU can process data and the core improves performance.

2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
When checkingt the compatability of the motherboard to the processor, the details that are being looked at is the socket to ensure proper chip insertion. Additionally, onboard wi-fi is looked at to ensure the PC has wireless capabilities, as well as the RAM slots, bluetooth, and graphic cards support (PCIe slots).

3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
Solid state drives are faster than hard disk drive, but it comes at a higher price point. Additionally, the SSD's are smaller. I would consider paying a higher price for small capacity SSD to run the operating system due to it being faster, but getting a larger size HDD for all files that need to be stored, but doesn't need to be run speedily.

4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
Considering someone coming from my background, I would explain the parts of a PC as simple as possible. A CPU (processor) is the brain of the computer. It runs the computer's operating system. The motherboard is the bridge between the CPU and all other components of the computer. It is what is used to help the CPU (that runs the operating system) talk to everything else that allows a computer to run efficiently. RAM is the memory of the computer. It is important to remmeber that this is temporary memory. The stored data for RAM is wiped when the computer is turned off. With more RAM, the computer is able to accomplish more, as it has more space to do so. In the article, RAM is reffered to as a table - but remember, the table is needs to be cleaned nightly before bed (my silly way of remembering that it is cleared at power off). Storage drive's are your SSDs and HDDs. This is where all of the data you've saved on your computer will be held until needed again. It is a permanent storage device. The power supply powers all of the components of the computer. It is important that the amount of power going to the device is enough to comfortably handle all of the components and the respective energy they need to run fluently. The case is the outer shell of the computer. This is necessary to protect all components on the inside, ensure they remain cool, and be nice to look at. The graphics card is used to speed up the processing time of video games, videos or pictures (things having to deal with the quality of the graphics), for intensive editing. A cooling system might be necessary in a computer that has a lot of components doing a lot of different things, therefore producing more heat than the average computer. The cooling system comes into play to keep all components at a safe temperature so nothing rises to a dangerous temperature that would case overheating and damage to these expensive parts.
