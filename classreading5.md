# Readings: Installing Virtualbox with Linux Terminal

## Linux Command line for beginner

### Questions from assignment
1. Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
- Shell - used to process the commands that are being placed.
- Terminal - is the remote location that works as an extension of the mainframe that consists of a keyboard and a screen.
- Cli - is the command line interface. It accepts the texts as inputs which then communicates with the operating system.
- Command prompt - this is where you input your text-based prompt and it elicits a response from the operating system.
-  They are still used today when we have graphical interfaces because these terminals still provide a way to swiftly and efficiently complete commands.

2. What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
- change directories (cd)
- list the file's contents (ls)
- rename/move files (mv)

3. What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
- Relative path is where you end up based on the current working directory. Absolute path is when the command given will have the same effect regardless of what the current working directory is. 

4. Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.

### Notes from reading 
- Unix: multi-user system that connected remotely via terminals (keyboard and screen).
- Unable to run programs locally at these terminals.
- Everything was sent to the mainframe as text, and the mainframe sent the output as text.
- commands were simple to decrease number of keystrokes.
- speed and efficiency is one of the reasons terminal is still widely used.
- linux is kind of a descendent of Unix. It is designed to function similarly.

## Things I want to know more about
