## The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S Companies

A hardware hack is different than a software hack in that a hardware hack can rewrite the code of the computer and have it communicate with other computers, simply from having a microchip connected with a smaller code. A software hack may cause systemic errors and may cause viruses.
I am unsure what the two ways are for altering a computer's hardware.
The hack worked by placing small microchips on devices, which then opened a secret gateway into any network that the affected devices were included. Additionally, the microchip came with a small code that allowed another computer on the network to communicate with the affected computer and perform remote damage from having access. 
Investigators were able to track the chips back to the source since this was a hardware act and there was physical evidence to be traced back to. U.S Intelligence agencies began tracking Supermicro's supply chain, which led to the location of the three primary manufacturers.

## How Computers Work

Computers are everywhere. Your wrist, pocket, bags, work, school - EVERYWHERE.
Computers were possibly designed to assist with thinking, and designed to manipulate information. 
Computers need to complete 4 tasks. Input, storage, processing, and output. 
Input - telling the computer what to do. Giving it the information to work.
Storage and processing - gives the computer information and then is stored. Information may be altered and then stored until sent to output.
Output - This is the result of telling the computer what to do. It manifests in many different ways.

Emphasis - all computers do the same 4 things.
